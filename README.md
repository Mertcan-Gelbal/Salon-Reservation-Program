The code is for a ticket selling program that reads a file containing discount and ticket information and lets customers buy tickets for different categories. The categories have different ticket prices, and discounts apply for purchases of different numbers of tickets.

The code opens the "discount.txt" file, reads the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased, category fees for each category, and discount amounts for each purchase amount for the categories. It stores this information in the variables maximumTicket, categoryFee, and discount.

The program creates a 20x20 Salon list to represent the seats in the cinema hall, where "-" indicates an empty seat, and "X" indicates a sold seat. The addTicket function lets the customer enter the category and number of tickets they want to buy, calculates the total amount, and reserves the seats.

The addTicket function first takes user inputs of the category and number of tickets to purchase. It then checks whether the entered values are valid or not. If they are, it calculates the total price of the tickets based on the category fee and discounts applied based on the number of tickets. It then reserves the seats and prints the seat numbers to the customer.
